A Kubernetes persistent volume (PV) is an object that allows pods to access persistent storage on a storage device, defined via a Kubernetes StorageClass. Unlike regular volumes, which are transient in nature, PVs are persistent, supporting stateful application use cases. A PV is a resource object in a Kubernetes cluster which continues to exist even after the pods using it have been destroyed.



PVs must be requested through persistent volume claims (PVCs), which are requests for storage. A PVC is essentially a request to mount a PV meeting certain requirements on a pod. PVCs do not specify a specific PVâ€”instead, they specify which StorageClass the pod requires. Administrators can define StorageClasses that indicate properties of storage devices, such as performance, service levels, and back-end policies.


A major advantage of the PVC pattern in Kubernetes is that it allows developers to dynamically request storage resources, without being aware of the implementation of underlying storage devices.
