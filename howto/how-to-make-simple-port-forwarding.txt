The kubectl port-forward  command allows you to access internal Kubernetes cluster processes within your local network. This method helps troubleshoot issues and set up services locally without exposing them.

kubectl features a built-in port forwarding functionality. The following is the process of mapping local to cluster ports in Kubernetes:

    A user interacts with Kubernetes using the kubectl command-line tool on their local machine.

    The port-forward command specifies the cluster resource name and defines the port number to port-forward to.

    As a result, the Kubernetes API server establishes a single HTTP connection between the localhost and the resource running on the cluster.

    The user can now directly engage that specific resource to diagnose an issue or debug if necessary.

In some cases, port-forwarding is the only way to access internal cluster resources.
