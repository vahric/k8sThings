What is Prometheus

Prometheus's multi-dimensional data model, PromQL (the Prometheus querying language), built-in alerting features, a pull vs. push approach, and, of course, the always expanding community are what set it apart from other time-series databases.

What is Grafana

An open-source, cross-platform online application for interactive visualization and analytics is called Grafana.


The two projects are now tightly connected, allowing users to quickly operate Prometheus on top of Kubernetes using the Prometheus Operator.


We are getting/collecting 3 things ...

Kube-state-metrics

kube-state-metrics (KSM) is a simple service that listens to the Kubernetes API server and generates metrics about the state of the objects
https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-state-metrics

Node-Exporter

Prometheus exporter for hardware and OS metrics exposed by *NIX kernels, written in Go with pluggable metric collectors.
https://github.com/prometheus/node_exporter

Lets start

Create Namespace for monitoring things like resource pool in vCenter

kubectl create namespace monitoring
namespace/monitoring created

*You should have helm client and prometheus community repo

helm repo add prometheus-community https://prometheus-community.github.io/helm-charts

run in shell> helm repo add prometheus-community https://prometheus-community.github.io/helm-charts
"prometheus-community" has been added to your repositories

run in shell>helm repo update
Hang tight while we grab the latest from your chart repositories...
...Successfully got an update from the "prometheus-community" chart repository
...Successfully got an update from the "bitnami" chart repository
Update Complete. ⎈Happy Helming!⎈

run in shell> helm repo list

NOTES:
kube-prometheus-stack has been installed. Check its status by running:
  kubectl --namespace monitoring get pods -l "release=prometheus"

Visit https://github.com/prometheus-operator/kube-prometheus for instructions on how to create & configure Alertmanager and Prometheus instances using the Operator.


Or ***

run in shell> helm install prometheus prometheus-community/kube-prometheus-stack --namespace monitoring --set alertmanager.enabled=false --set grafana.service.type=LoadBalancer

Or ***

Use varaibles file -f
